## Positioning Schemes

### Static Positioning
Static positioning is the default css positioning property. It follows the normal flow of the document. Each block-level element begins on a new line.

### Relative Positioning
Relative positioning keeps the element within the normal flow of the document and allows you to shift it's position based upon it's origin.

### Absolute Positioning
Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Translating it up, down, left or right is done relative to it's parent container.

### Fixed Positioning
Fixed positioning removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Using the top,left,right or down properties will position the element relative to the browser window.

### Sticky Positioning
Sticky positioning behaves as a mixture of fixed and absolute positioning. Elements with sticky position can scroll on the page until it hits a certain point and remains fixed to that location.

### Z-Index
If there are overlapping elements in your document, you can provide a z-index property to dictate which element is in the foreground and which is in the background.
