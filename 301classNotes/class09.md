## Functional Programming

Functional programming is a paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that avoids changing state and mutable data.

Immutable - unable to be changed

To keep programs immutable you use recursion.

Higher order functions either: 
- take one or more functions as arguments
- return a function as its result
