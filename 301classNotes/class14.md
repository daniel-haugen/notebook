## Questions

- What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
Consumer-grade personal computers became available on the market and they were marketed entirely to men and boys.

- Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
It matters because males have a huge amount of privledge and advantage when studying computers because they are more familiarized with it.

- Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
- What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
The first take-a-way, FANG and Microsoft, most of the larger companies on this table are the least diverse. 
Second take-a-way, Latino and Black folk are the least represented in the industry.
Third take-a-way, not a single company has a male / female distribution that matches the US population.

- Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company
- When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most succesful when there are clear metrics that guide your strategy. Once goals are set, it's equally important to have a clear method of measuring up to your goals for accountability's sake.
- Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diverse companies perform better because their userbase is likely diverse and they'll create a better product that is suitable for a wider range of individuals.

- Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
A less-impactful but microcosmic example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base can be found in Joelle Emerson's "Why diversity matters to your tech company":
> When YouTubeâ€™s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
