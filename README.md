## About Me 
I would like to acknowledge that we are on the traditional land of the first people of Seattle, the Duwamish People past and present and honor with gratitude the land itself and the Duwamish Tribe.

I've worked in digital marketing for 5-6 years and my desire to automate my job has directed my learning towards programming. I'm currently attending Code Fellows to study Full-Stack Javascript Software Development. My expected graduation date is August 2021.
