## HTML Structure and Markup

## HTML5 Layout

In the beginning, everything was a div container. Now there are more tags available to give your code more semantic meaning. They all act as div containers though.

Here's some of the tags:
1. <header>
2. <footer>
3. <nav>
4. <article>
5. <aside>
6. <section>
7. <hgroup>
8. <figure> and <figcaption>

If the container is not serving one of these purposes, use a div container.
