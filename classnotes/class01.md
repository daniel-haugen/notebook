## HTML Structure and Markup

## HTML5 Layout

In the beginning, everything was a div container. Now there are more tags available to give your code more semantic meaning. They all act as div containers though.

Here's some of the tags:
1. `<header>`
2. `<footer>`
3. `<nav>`
4. `<article>`
5. `<aside>`
6. `<section>`
7. `<hgroup>`
8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`

If the container is not serving one of these purposes, use a div container.

You can wrap containers in `<a>` tags to make the entire container a link.

Older browsers that can't run HTML5 won't understand the new tags.
