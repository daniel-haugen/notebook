## HTML Structure and Markup

## HTML5 Layout

In the beginning, everything was a div container. Now there are more tags available to give your code more semantic meaning. They all act as div containers though.

Here's some of the tags:
1. `<header>`
2. `<footer>`
3. `<nav>`
4. `<article>`
5. `<aside>`
6. `<section>`
7. `<hgroup>`
8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`

If the container is not serving one of these purposes, use a div container.

You can wrap containers in `<a>` tags to make the entire container a link.

Older browsers that can't run HTML5 won't understand the new tags.

## Process and Design

1. ### Answer the Questions
    - Who is the target audience?
    - Why are they visiting your website?
    - What is your visitor trying to achieve?
    - What information does the visitor need?
    - How often will people visit your site?
2. ### Sitemap
It can be useful to create a card for each page of the website so you can visually move and group related pages to create a site heirarchy.

3. ### Wireframe
The wireframe is the layout design of the website. It designates the containers, their pixel width, and the information that will fill the box.

## ABC of Programming

A script is just a list of steps for a computer to process.
Define your goal, then define the steps required to reach the goal.

Objects are things in programming that may have one or multipe properties.

Javascript can detect events in the browser and order certain code to run in response.

Each element in HTML is considered a node, which is a type of object

Javascript is run where it is found in the HTML document.
