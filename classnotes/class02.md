| `<p>` | paragraph text |
| `<b> <i>` | bold and italic |

| `<blockquote> <q>` | blockquote is used for paragraph-long quotes, the `<q>` tag is for short quotes within a `<p>` tag. |
| `<abbr>` | abbr is used to specify the full term. |
| `<cite> <dfn>` | When referencing source, use the cite element. `<dfn>` is used to provide the definition to a word. |
| `<address>` | used to wrap information regarding the author of the webpage. |
| `<ins> <del> <s>` | `<del>` is a strikethrough, `<ins>` is underlined. `<s>` is strikethrough. |
