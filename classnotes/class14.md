## What Google Learned From Its Quest To Build the Perfect Team

### Psych Safety
 After a tremendous amount of study, the only recognizable pattern that researchers can find to predict whether or not a team will be succesful is whether or not there is psychological safety within the group. Psychological safety is defined as the freedom to express ideas without fear of being roasted by your group. Essentially, demonstrate empathy, be communicative, show some active listening skills and be a natural human. This creates better work conditions for focus and creative problem solving.
