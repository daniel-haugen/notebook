The about me lab's assignment is to build a web page that quizzes the user with 5 "yes or no" trivia questions about my background. Take the quiz and then find more information about me.

### Reflections and Comments
- Overall this lab assignment went fairly smoothly (so long as a I did it right..)
- CSS layout and positioning is strange. Especially getting text to wrap a certain way within other divs.
- Overall it took me maybe 1-2 hours to get the javascript portion sorted out. The rest was just battling with CSS until I became too frustrated. 
- It is `getElementById` and not `getElementbyId` (1 hour mistake)
